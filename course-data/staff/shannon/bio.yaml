responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I am royalty descended from the distant land of Shooberia, where I led the
    royal doggo cavalry into many glorious battles. By the age of 8, I had conquered
    the Eastern Hemisphere, and had made substantial headway into the land now known as
    North America. It was during this conquest that I discovered the Beauty and Joy of Computing,
    as well as it's wonderful mascot Alonzo. I was immediately convinced by the mission of
    BJC, and have remained at Cal since to defend it.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I have programmed many things, including a robotic doggo army that lays dormant
    around Cal, ready to defend the campus at a moment's notice. I have come across many
    languages at Cal, but only Snap! has been worthy of remaining in my memory.
