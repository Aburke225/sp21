responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - Towards the end of senior year, I discovered a hidden water slide that
    seemed to traverse space and time itself. After enjoying my summer break
    and making preparations, I went into the slide and found myself in
    Strawberry Creek consequently. As I exited the water slide, it collapsed
    behind me, something I took as a sign for me to stay here at Cal.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - Although I first experienced coding through CS10, I discovered yet another
    anomaly that allowed me to dive through the fabric of space and time. This time however,
    I communed with the coding gods themselves, only returning to this mortal plane
    after accumulating lifetimes worth of programming experience. It was only after
    this that I felt I was sufficiently ready for 61A (jk).

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - Spontaneously exploring the multiverse. Teaching CS10. Mining the crafts.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - Yes.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - It is not clear to me if my life has offered me any such experience yet...
    Although I've been told that diving through space and time would count.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - I would hope that I have no commitments that consume cycles. Bike theft is a serious
    crime in Berkeley and should be dealt with in the most decisive of manners.
