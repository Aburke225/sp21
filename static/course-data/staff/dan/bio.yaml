  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I grew up in The Bronx, NY (“You got a problem with dat?” – that’s how they talked in my old neighborhood, no joke)
    until I was 9. The Bronx is one of the 5 Boroughs of New York City, if you didn’t know. I moved to Westchester (suburb of New York)
    for a year and then upstate to a small town near Cooperstown, NY (where the Baseball Hall of Fame is located). I graduated from
    Cooperstown Central High, went on to MIT where I got a double major in CS and EE and graduated in 5 years.
    Then I came to Cal as a grad student, did a MS in Game Theory in 1995 and a PhD in Graphics in 2000, got bitten by the teaching bug
    and joined the faculty (in the teaching track) in 2000.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I started with Basic in high school in 1985. At MIT I learned Scheme (in the class CS61A was modeled after, taught by the authors of SICP) 
    and C. When I got to Berkeley, I learned Tcl/Tk, Java, Python, Unix, Matlab, Mathematica, html & perl. My current favorite language is Python, 
    definitely.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I can juggle 5 balls, ride a unicycle (poorly), spin things on my finger, play the harmonica and congas badly (partly because I can’t read music), 
    recite entire Monty Python sketches, hit a golf ball 275 yds (though I have yet to break 90!), do an L hang, and wiggle my ears.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - In high school, I tied the school record in the 200m dash (23.2 s) and I was the fastest rapid calculator in central NY (~100 high schools). My high school 
    basketball team went to the state final four game, and our team was recently inducted to our high school athletic hall of fame! In 2012 I was 
    chosen as an ACM Distinguished Educator. In 2007 I lived in Melbourne (Australia) for 5 months, and I also climbed half-dome a decade ago. 
    I’ve seen a bit of the world (Australia, New Zealand, China, Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, Brazil, Qatar, Greece, Spain) but have lots of travel 
    ahead of me.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - In high school, I tied the school record in the 200m dash (23.2 s) and I was the fastest rapid calculator in central NY (~100 high schools). My high school 
    basketball team went to the state final four game, and our team was recently inducted to our high school athletic hall of fame! In 2012 I was chosen as an 
    ACM Distinguished Educator. In 2007 I lived in Melbourne (Australia) for 5 months, and I also climbed half-dome a decade ago. I’ve seen a bit of the world 
    (Australia, New Zealand, China, Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, Brazil, Qatar, Greece, Spain) but have lots of travel ahead of me.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - In addition to this class, I’m also teaching CS10 and CNM190 (Advanced Digital Animation) a year-long course that teaches students how to make Pixar-quality 
    short films. I supervise three awesome DeCals\":" GamesCrafters, UCBUGG and iOS Programming. I’m on the undergraduate study and chairing the awards committee, 
    and I do EECS and L&S faculty advising. I’m on more advisory boards than I can count, and I’m the local faculty champion for our CSTA chapter. I have three 
    awesome grad students. Finally, and most importantly, I’ve got a wonderful wife, and a son and daughter with whom I try to spend as much time as possible. 
    Phew!
